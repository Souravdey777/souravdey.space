**Before 2014**

> My dad served in the Indian Air Force, and we traveled quite a bit during my early years. From Delhi to Rajasthan, and then to Kharagpur, I've experienced different places and cultures. Eventually, we settled down in Asansol, West Bengal, which has been home ever since.
> <br/>
> My childhood was filled with great adventures and lots of fun. I must admit, academics weren't my strong suit back then, and truth be told, they still aren't my strongest area. However, I managed to secure average scores in my 10th and 12th grades. Unfortunately, I faced the untimely loss of my father just before my 12th exams, which had a profound impact on my life. He will always be my role model and inspiration.
> <br/>
> But, It was during the same time that I discovered my passion for coding, starting with languages like C, C++, and Basic SQL. This ignited my interest in pursuing computer science.
