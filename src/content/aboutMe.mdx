### Hey there!

I'm a {currentAge()}-year-old **software developer** hailing from the beautiful state of **West Bengal, India**.

Let me take you on a journey through my story. It all began on 11th August, 1996 when I was born in West Bengal.\
My dad served in the Indian Air Force, and we traveled quite a bit during my early years. From Delhi to Rajasthan, and then to Kharagpur, I've experienced different places and cultures. Eventually, we settled down in Asansol, West Bengal, which has been home ever since.

My childhood was filled with great adventures and lots of fun. I must admit, academics weren't my strong suit back then, and truth be told, they still aren't my strongest area. However, I managed to secure average scores in my 10th and 12th grades. Unfortunately, I faced the untimely loss of my father just before my 12th exams, which had a profound impact on my life. It was during my senior secondary years that I discovered my passion for coding, starting with languages like C, C++, and Basic SQL. This ignited my interest in pursuing computer science.

I pursued my graduation from a college in Howrah, West Bengal, spending four years there. While my grades remained average, this was when I truly delved into building apps and projects. It all began with an internship at HP, where I had the opportunity to create some exciting stuff. The experience fueled my desire to develop more projects. I found myself spending more time building random apps than sitting in classrooms. Freelancing also became a part of my journey during my final year.

**2018 - 2020**\
Following my graduation, I embarked on a new adventure as an **System Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services** in Bangalore. TCS provided me with a platform to explore various technologies, programming languages, and frameworks. I was fortunate to work with exceptional mentors and on exciting projects. I dived into web technologies, design, and even a bit of marketing. I started building projects from scratch, pitching them to stakeholders, and collaborating with talented individuals. My efforts were recognized with awards and accolades, and I was honored to become a part of TCS Digital.

**2020 - 2021**\
However, a significant shift occurred in March 2020 when I returned home. Suddenly, I had ample time on my hands. That's when I decided to participate in hackathons, contribute to open source projects, engage in online events, and even take up some freelancing work. It was during this time that I joined **HackerRank as a Software Development Engineer 2**, bringing along three years of experience from TCS.

**2022 - Now**\
After I joined HackerRank, I must admit I experienced the common imposter syndrome that many of us face in our careers. However, I was determined to overcome it and grow as a developer. At HackerRank, my primary focus is on frontend development, where I have the opportunity to contribute to the HackerRank B2B screening product.
Although I am not currently building products from the ground up, my role involves tackling complex technical challenges and finding innovative solutions to existing problems. I find great satisfaction in this work as it allows me to apply my skills and creativity to improve the platform and enhance user experiences.

Working at HackerRank has been an incredible learning experience, exposing me to new technologies, industry best practices, and a vibrant community of developers. I've had the chance to collaborate with talented individuals, share ideas, and contribute to the continuous evolution of the platform.

**Through my journey of 5 years, I've gained invaluable insights into software development, honed my technical skills, and developed a passion for building impactful solutions. I am excited to bring this expertise to the table and collaborate on new projects that push the boundaries of innovation.**

**Join me on this exciting journey as we leverage technology to create remarkable.**
