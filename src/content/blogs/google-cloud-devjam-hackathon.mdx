# Background

This blog is the penned-down version of the 1-month long experience of Google Cloud Dev Jam Hackathon 2020.

I got a mail from [TechGig](https://www.techgig.com) about Google Cloud Dev Jam in May 2020. It was the same time when I was taking online courses on Google Cloud some of them are mentioned below:

- [Smart Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI on Google Cloud](https://coursera.org/share/98e092cc1e1f377d0e317b9147ff4f2f)
- [Building Batch Data Pipelines on Google Cloud](https://coursera.org/share/6d2f2a54f5fe2f76039f31f8d622dfd1)
- [Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://coursera.org/share/f2ad79ec9aaa6812bfc0369fc4d67018)
- [Modernizing Data Lakes and Data Warehouses with Google Cloud](https://coursera.org/share/9abcd8b6cb755f8ebabfc28e26f78560)

While all this was not enough I got into a **TCS Digital Garage** team and I started building the web and the backend of this new product called **TCS ClickFit**, and Guess what? I was using Google Cloud services in this too.
I was using a bunch of different services like Cloud Function, Cloud Storage, FireStore, Google CDN, Vision AI, AutoML, Dialogflow and many more.

So, No doubt this was the right time for me to take part in Google Cloud Dev Jam. So, I registered for this 8-month-long program. I was putting in really good effort every month to be at the Top of the leaderboard.

I have previously used Firebase and a few services and also deployed websites in different hosting platforms. But, I first understood the basics of any cloud technology during this phase.

Now, Here is how I was learning during the program:

- I was attending webinars & online assessments as a part of the program in TechGig.
- I was getting hands-on experience in Quicklabs and also within the org. - [My Public Profile](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/public_profiles/1d322360-c921-424b-b21d-d5d1d4f9f012)
- I started mentoring peers in TCS and upskilling developers with Google Cloud Skills

# Google Cloud Dev Jam Hackathon 2020

Now, I reached out to [**Poulami**](https://www.linkedin.com/in/poulami-saha-she-her-hers-5b2bab152/). She was also a part of the program and teamed up together. The name of the team was **Cloud Burst**

## Learning

While we didn't win the Hackathon. At the end of the program. I was 19th position on the leaderboard out of 89000+ people. That was a great outcome. Plus, It was fun and a good learning experience.
