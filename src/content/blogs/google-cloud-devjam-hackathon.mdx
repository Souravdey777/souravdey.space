## Background

This blog is the penned-down version of the 1-month long experience of Google Cloud Dev Jam Hackathon 2020.

I got a mail from [TechGig]() about Google Cloud Dev Jam in may, 2020. And It was the same time when I was taking a few online courses on Google Cloud: 
[Smart Analytics, Machine Learning, and AI on Google Cloud](https://coursera.org/share/98e092cc1e1f377d0e317b9147ff4f2f), [Building Batch Data Pipelines on Google Cloud](https://coursera.org/share/6d2f2a54f5fe2f76039f31f8d622dfd1), [Google Cloud Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals](https://coursera.org/share/f2ad79ec9aaa6812bfc0369fc4d67018), [Modernizing Data Lakes and Data Warehouses with Google Cloud](https://coursera.org/share/9abcd8b6cb755f8ebabfc28e26f78560).
While all this was not enough I got into a new team in TCS and I started building the web and the backend of this new product, TCS ClickFit, and Guess what I was using? Google Cloud services. I was using a bunch of different services like Cloud Function, Cloud Storage, FireStore, [Google CDN](), [Google Vision AI], [AutoML], [Dialogflow]

So, No doubts this was the right time for me to take part in Google Cloud Dev Jam. So, I registered for this 8 month long program. I was putting really good effort every month to be in the TOp of the leaderboard

While I have previously used Firebase and deployed websites in different hosting websites. I first understood the basics of any cloud technology during the june-aug, 2020.

- I also took part in the Google cloud dev jam 2020.
  - I was attending webinars
  - I was getting hands-on experience in Quicklabs and also within the org.
  - I started mentoring folks in TCS and upskilling developers with Google Cloud.

The learning that I had in the process was great. I solved interesting challenges. It helped me
