It all started with a Dialogflow Course I was doing. Once, I had learned the skills, I wanted to develop something where I can get a better hands-on experience.

So, This Idea of COVID-19 Info Bot popped into my mind.

Initially, I just wanted to create a chatbot that will be capable enough to give the stats of COVID-19 cases in each state. There are already a lot of APIs out there which are free to use and easy to implement. After a bit of research 😅, I finally got an API for getting the latest data on COVID-19 cases in India using Graphql.

Now, I had to create Webhooks. ⚓️

After a lot of struggle and 2 sleepless 😪 nights, I figured out that I need help 😆. So, for Webhooks I found this medium post:\

Finally Developed Dialogflow webhooks with NodeJs here you can find the backend source code in Github. 👇

This webhook is making requests to COVID-19 API which is taking the response object and molding it as per the response required for Dialogflow. It is hosted in **Heroku**.

> With Dialogflow I have created Intents like this and all Indian states are the Entities.
>
> For making the bot capable of answering general COVID19 Questions I used the knowledge bases functionality of Dialogflow.

Now the Chatbot was ready to be used with Dialogflow web demo https://bot.dialogflow.com/1caa8f0d-744f-4a2a-baa4-6caba611ac41 or with Google Assistants or Alexa.

But to make a customized User Interface I created the website using React Js. Here is the Source Code 👇
