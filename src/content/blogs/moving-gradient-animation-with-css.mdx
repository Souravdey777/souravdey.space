## Moving Gradient animation with CSS 🎨

Simple animations can bring a huge difference to your websites.
Let's build something simple and unique.

### Complete page background animation with CSS moving gradient

<CodePenEmbed slugHash="poROYza" />

> The above Codepen example shows a moving gradient animation on the whole body of the website.

Code snippet for the animation effect.

HTML 👇

```HTML
<body>
  <h1>
     Animation effect on "body"
  </h1>
</body>
```

CSS 👇

```CSS
body {
  background: -webkit-linear-gradient(
    -70deg,
    #a2facf,
    #64acff
  );
  background-size: 400% 400%;
  animation: gradient 5s ease infinite;
}

@keyframes gradient {
  0% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
  50% {
    background-position: 100% 50%;
  }
  100% {
    background-position: 0% 50%;
  }
}
```

#### what is actually happening ??

The ** background size here is 400% 400%** and the background is moving. Thus, the animation is happening.

A lot of cool stuff can be code with this type of animation.

### 1. 🌈 Rainbow Effect

<CodePenEmbed slugHash="JjEmYRQ" />

> The above Codepen example shows a 🌈 rainbow effect.

This is similar to the animation that we saw in the previous example but with 7 colors.

### 2. Loader for cards and simple components.

<CodePenEmbed slugHash="dyNgYZY" />

> The above Codepen example shows a loader 🐌 with the same gradient animation.

### 3. Implementing the same effect on a button or cards

<CodePenEmbed slugHash="WNRaGMB" />

> The above Codepen example shows 🌈 the rainbow effect on a button.

### 4. On Hover the same animation effect

<CodePenEmbed slugHash="ExZdNav" />

> Animation on hovering on the card

### Configurable parameters

#### → Changing the `background-size`

#### → Changing the `time-duration`

#### → Changing the `degree` of the linear gradient.

Now, put on your creative 🤠 hats and make an interesting animation effect with moving gradients.
