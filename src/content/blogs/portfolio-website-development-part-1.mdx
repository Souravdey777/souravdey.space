This blog is regarding the process of Portfolio Website Development.

**Part 2** will be after the website is complete.

Currently, While writing this blog the website is under development but the first page is hosted.

To keep consistency I am following the Design That I created.

## Technical Stack

The current technical stack for my portfolio website is HTML, CSS, Next.js, React.js, Vercel Cloud and Notion as headless CMS

## Sections in the website.

- About/Home Page
- Work Experience
- Projects
- Tech Skill - with the option to endorse
- Contact me

## Personal Branding Steps that I have planned for and working toward it.

- Completion of the portfolio website.
- A 3D Avatar 👦
- Profile picture consistency and a bit more professional 👔 may be.
- Blog banners with consistent design and changing the previous banners.
- Fonts family and Colors Consistency.

I am not sure how much time it will take to complete and I will try my best. 🤞

Will appreciate the suggestion in the comments.
