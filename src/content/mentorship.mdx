I am passionate about mentorship and have been guiding and empowering aspiring software developers for over three years. Mentoring has always been a rewarding experience for me, and I find great joy in helping others achieve their goals in the tech industry.

## Experience

**Mentored 150+ individuals:** I have had the privilege of mentoring over 150 individuals, supporting them in their professional growth and helping them navigate their career paths.

As a way of giving back to the community, I offer a limited number of **free mentorship** opportunities. I believe in the importance of accessibility and want to contribute to the growth of aspiring developers who may not have the means to access paid mentorship.

In addition to my free mentorship slots, I also offer **paid mentorship** services. If you're looking for a more personalized and dedicated mentoring experience, I provide one-on-one sessions where we can focus on your specific needs, goals, and challenges.
