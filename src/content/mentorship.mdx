# /mentorship 👨🏻‍🏫

I am passionate about mentorship and have been guiding and empowering aspiring software developers for over three years. Mentoring has always been a rewarding experience for me, and I find great joy in helping others achieve their goals in the tech industry.

## Experience

I am amongst the top ✨ [10% Mentors in Software Development](https://adplist.org/mentors/sourav-dey) in India!

Clocked up more than 10k+ minutes of mentorship with over 250+ individuals from 40+ different countries across various platforms, supporting them in their professional growth and helping them navigate their career paths.
